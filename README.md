# Hopf-Bifurcation-Project
This project utilizes the Holling-Tanner predator-prey model to analytically determine values of parameters within the equations to stimulate a healthy oscillatory cycle. To accomplish this, Python is used to perform the computational legwork and provides visualizations of the findings in order to ease comprehension.

# Project Report
The project report can be found above in the .pdf file, providing meaning to the equations and graphs in the interactive file. Primarily, concepts from differential equations and linear algebra were utilized to determine the values where Hopf Bifurcations occur, among other variables.
